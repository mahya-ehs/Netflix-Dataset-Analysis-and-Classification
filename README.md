# Netflix Dataset Analysis and Classification

1. **Statistical Comparison of Directors:** In the first phase, the project conducts a statistical comparison between the number of films directed by each director and the average number of films by directors.

2. **Pattern Extraction between Directors, Cast, and Genre:** The second phase involves extracting patterns between directors, cast, and genre using the dataset.

3. **Classification of Genres:** In the third phase, the project classifies the dataset based on genres, and it includes the capability to predict the genre of a movie from the description of the test data.
